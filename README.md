My personal Neovim config templated from kickstart.nvim

This is fairly minimal. No file explorer (I use a terminal file navigator) + no buffer management because I use tabs (it's actually much better than a bunch of buffers that urges you to tab through them because they would be at the top of your editor) + no startify stuff. Just telescope + a common set of extensions that works.
